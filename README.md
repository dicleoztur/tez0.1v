# Detecting Subjectivity in Turkish News Texts (M.S. Thesis Project)

This repository contains the supervised learning framework and experimental setup for my Master's Thesis: **"Detecting Subjectivity in the News Texts in Turkish Language"** (Boğaziçi University, 2014).

### Purpose: Distinguishing Opinion from Fact
Automated recognition of subjectivity is a complex task that goes beyond simple sentiment analysis. While sentiment analysis focuses on polarity (positive/negative), subjectivity detection investigates the methods of distinguishing a **factual voice** from a **subjective tone**.


---

### Approach & Methodology 
This work proposes a novel feature extraction method and comparison of learning algorithms for subjectivity clues in Turkish, focusing on:
* **Lexical & POS Attributes:** Extracting subjectivity features from word-level features, N-grams, Part-of-Speech tag attributes and sentiment-laden keywords.
* **Supervised Learning Framework:** Development of an ML-based system with various classifier models to predict the subjective attitude of a piece of text.
* **Original Dataset & Annotation:** Creation of a unique ground truth dataset consisting of labelled Turkish news texts, based on a custom-developed annotation scheme.
* **Experimental Depth:** Experiments comparing different features and models (SVM, Naive Bayes) to optimize prediction accuracy.

### Repository Contents
* **ML Basis:** Code for feature extraction and classification.
* **Morphological Analysis:** Custom tools for handling the rich and complex morphology of the Turkish language.
* **Framework:** The structure for ablation studies of features and model comparison.

### Research & Legacy
This work was one of the early studies on Turkish subjectivity analysis.
